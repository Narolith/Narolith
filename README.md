Hello, my name is Stephen!  I have been pursuing my passion for programming for 4 years.
I have experience in projects over a wide range of languages (C#, JS/TS, Python) and types (Console, Web Apps, Desktop Apps, Mobile Apps)
I love working on hobby projects when I can and I am always open to helping others how I can.
